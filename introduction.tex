\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}

This little handbook is based on the content of the
\href{http://advent.plackperl.org/}{Plack Advent Calendar} website. The
calendar had 24 useful short posts explaining the concept of PSGI and
how to adapt existing web applications to Plack.

The calendar was so successful it's been considered a canonical
reference for many beginners trying to learn Plack and for web framework
authors trying to adapt their code to work with PSGI.

But the content was written three years ago and some of it is a little
dated. In this book I tried to get it correct and up-to-date, and it
will continue to be updated as we find errata and get feedback from the
reader community.

Raw source code of the book, in Markdown format, is available on
\href{https://github.com/miyagawa/plack-handbook}{GitHub repository}
